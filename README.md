# The most detailed experiments and explaination of Chrome dinosaur on GitHub

Chome dinosaur is a game very suitable for beginners in deep reinforcement learning. In this repository, I will not only show the result of baseline DQN, but also compare its results with double DQN, Rainbow, policy gradient and Actor-Critic Algorithms.

* [Baseline DQN](#Baseline DQN) 
* Double DQN 
* Rainbow
* Policy gradient
* Actor-Critic Algorithms

I have also implemented a real-time browser demo here.
If you are not familar with Q-learing, you can visit a more fundamental project, Q-learning for Tic-Tac-Toe (GitHub Repo) and the real-time interactive streamlit demo.


The following is a detailed explaination of each approach and their environment setting in Chrome Dinosaur.
